              If your order hasn't arrived by the estimated delivery date, we recommend first checking with your neighbors to see if the courier may have left the parcel at their address. Additionally, please inspect any safe areas around your property where the driver might have placed your parcel, such as your garden shed or porch. If you still unable to find your parcel, then please contact us and we will try our best to assist you.
